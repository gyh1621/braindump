## Manage four general system area {#manage-four-general-system-area}

Processes
: determine which processes are allowed to use the CPU

Memory
: keep track of all memory - allocated to one, shared, or free

Device drivers
: kernel acts as an interface hardware and processes
    -   drivers are inside the kernel

System calls and support
: processes may use system calls to communicate with kernel
    -   fork()
    -   exec()
    -   start a new process

        ```nil
            shell -> fork() -> shell
                            -> copy of shell -> exec(program) -> program
        ```
