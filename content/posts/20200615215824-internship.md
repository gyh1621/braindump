## 如何问问题 {#如何问问题}

当然badger人问问题也是有点技巧的，我自己比较常用的是下面几个，不知道地里其他当过mentor/manager的人会对我这种mentee怎么想

1.  “大哥我想了解这个，你有文档给我读吗”“大哥有没有你觉得对我比较有用的文档”（这之后我想问任何问题都会先问文档再问人）
2.  把问题记下来，一次性多问几个。脸皮厚一点的话主动book个会
3.  这点我觉得是最重要的，问任何问题之前，先自己在wiki/代码文档里做一下research，这样会尽量减少“你问的问题其实很弱智”的概率
4.  但是像一些小问题不是很紧急的，可以攒一些问题一起问了，或者因为wfh打字不方便，可以book对方一个半小时或者1小时在calendar上，大概说下topics to discuss，完全没问题。如果你在讨论中还能show出你已经做了一些research，只是还是没办法解决，你的mentor会更觉得你很主动和独立而不是伸手党，也是加分
5.  问完后叙述一遍自己的理解
