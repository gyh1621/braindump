This article could also be called "What NOT to Put in Your PowerPoint Presentation."

First, take a look at the following webpages. These fall under the category DEATH BY POWERPOINT.

Some basic rules:

-   Bulleted lists are for showing the viewer what you will be covering by topic. They should be brief, as in, not verbose.
-   Repeat after me "A PowerPoint presentation is NOT my script."
-   Repeat after me "People don't like to read videos. The words on the screen get jumbled up with the words being said."
-   The script for the presenter belongs in the notes section.
-   ILLUSTRATE what you are presenting on the screen. Use the handy-dandy animations in PowerPoint. They are quite fun once you get the hang of them.
-   DO NOT USE stock images, or anything that you happened to "borrow" from the Internet. You are probably presenting architecture or some other process. Use the AWS icons available from Aiden Duffy.
-   Try not to animate text. I know it's hard, especially after you have learned to use the animations.
-   Don't animate everything. Yes, I know, it's fun.
-   Don't crowd the screen. The eyes need someplace to rest. If you have a lot on the screen, consider breaking the concept down into smaller chunks and put them on sequential slides.
-   Okay that's all I have for now. I will probably think of more...in the middle of the night...and then happily forget it by morning.
