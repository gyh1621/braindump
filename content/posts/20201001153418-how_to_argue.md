### 部分附和 {#部分附和}

-   We definitely see your point on.
    Thanks for pointing out <span class="underline">\_</span>.

-   In some sense we agree with your point because <span class="underline">\_</span>.
    There is some truth in what you said about <span class="underline">\_</span>.

-   While we agree <span class="underline">\_</span>, we still think <span class="underline">\_</span>.

-   As you mentioned, <span class="underline">\_</span>.


### 总体反对 {#总体反对}


#### Deal with cherry picks {#deal-with-cherry-picks}

-   There are other contributing factors here, and we would like to highlight <span class="underline"><span class="underline">\_</span></span>

-   This does not show us the full picture.
    This is not the whole picture because we are missing <span class="underline">\_\_</span>

-   We cannot overlook the importance of <span class="underline">\_</span>
    We cannot ignore the fact that <span class="underline">\_</span>

-   That's an isolated data point and dose not tell the whole story.

-   Things are more complicated/nuanced than that/than how they are being described.
    Let's not oversimplify things.


#### Deal with spin {#deal-with-spin}

-   I tend to interpret this a different way.
    I'm leaning towards a different interpretation of what happened.

-   We are putting too much emphasis on <span class="underline">\_</span>.

-   We found strong evidence to believe this is not due to <span class="underline">\_</span>, but rather due to <span class="underline">\_</span>.

-   While it is tempting to believe/conclude that <span class="underline">\_</span>, I think we need to be more realistic/careful about it.
