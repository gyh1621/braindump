## Origin {#origin}

All programming languages are abstractions to better map the real world
problem to computer world.

Some early programming languages chose particular views of the world:

-   [LISP]({{< relref "20210106170212-lisp" >}}): All problems are ultimately lists
-   Prolog: Cast all problems into chains of decisions

But when step outside of that domain, they become awkward.

OOP is a more general way to abstract the real world.
Just like things/objects in the real world have characteristics and actions,
objects in OOP have states and performe operations.
When reading the codes, it's like reading the description of the problem.

> An object in OOP havs state, behavior and identity(unique memeory space). - Grady Booch


### Class {#class}

A class describes a set of objects that have identical characteritics and behaviors.

> Concept of **Class**: first used directly in Simula-67


## Design {#design}


### Think objects as service provider {#think-objects-as-service-provider}

-   break down large problems to smaller ones from top to bottom
    ask from the top: what would be needed to accomplish this goal?
-   try not let one object do too much types of service


### Distinguish Roles {#distinguish-roles}

[Access Control]({{< relref "20210106173814-access_control" >}}): keep a boundry between class creators and client programmer.
