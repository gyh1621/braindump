Determine who can use the definitions that follow.

-   public
    The element is available to everyone

-   private
    No one can access that element except the creator.

    Anyone trying to access this kind of elements illegally gets [compile time error]({{< relref "20210106175817-compile_time_error" >}}).

-   protected
    Like **private**, but inheriting class may access **protected** members.

-   default (class)
    Also called **package access**.

    Classes can access members of other classes in the same package.
    Outside the package, these members remain **private**.
