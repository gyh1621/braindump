## Objects {#objects}


### Identifiers in Java are all references {#identifiers-in-java-are-all-references}

object references stored in [stack]({{<relref "20210108151044-where_storage_lives.md" >}}), objects stored in [heap]({{<relref "20210108151044-where_storage_lives.md" >}})


### Not all identifiers have objects connected {#not-all-identifiers-have-objects-connected}

```java
String s;  // no objects connected
String s = "asdf";  // an object connected
```


### Create objects using `new` {#create-objects-using-new}

`String s = new String("asdf");`


## Primitive Types {#primitive-types}

-   variable holds the value directly, placed on the [stack]({{<relref "20210108151044-where_storage_lives.md" >}})
-   sizes of primitive types don't change on different machine architectures
-   all numeric types are signed
-   size of boolean is defined to take the literal values true or false
-   **Autoboxing** automatically converts a primitive to a wrapped object and back
-   when fields of a Class are primitive types, they have default values; local variables not
    `int x;  // x will get some arbitrarty value`, use before assigned a value will cause compile time error

## Scoping of variables {#scoping-of-variables}

\#[Object Creation & Lifetime]({{<relref "20210106165752-oop.md" >}})

-   a variable defined inside a scope is no longer accessiable outside of the scope
-   hide a variable in a larger scope is not allowed in Java

    ```java
      {
          int x = 12;
          {
              int x = 96;  // illegal
          }
      }
    ```
-   primitive types are released outside of the scope beacuse they are stored on the [stack]({{<relref "20210108151044-where_storage_lives.md" >}})
-   objects persist past the end of the scope, references are released


## [Namespaces]({{< relref "20210108165204-namespaces" >}}) {#namespaces--20210108165204-namespaces-dot-md}

Java use reversed URLs.
Every file automatically live in their own namespaces.
Each class within a file has a unique identifier.

Problem: deep directory path, many of them are empty (e.g. com)


## `static` keyword {#static-keyword}

\#[static]({{< relref "20210108200839-static" >}})


### Purposes {#purposes}

1.  want a single, shared piece of storage for a particular field
2.  want a method that isn't associated with any paticular object of this class


## Arrays {#arrays}

-   a Java array is guarenteed to be initialized and cannot be accessed outside of its range
-   when creating an array of objects, an array of references (value is `null`) are actually created


## [Access Control]({{< relref "20210106173814-access_control" >}}) {#access-control--20210106173814-access-control-dot-md}

Determine who can use the definitions that follow.

-   public
    The element is available to everyone

-   private
    No one can access that element except the creator.

    Anyone trying to access this kind of elements illegally gets [compile time error]({{< relref "20210106175817-compile_time_error" >}}).

-   protected
    Like **private**, but inheriting class may access **protected** members.

-   default (class)
    Also called **package access**.

    Classes can access members of other classes in the same package.
    Outside the package, these members remain **private**.
