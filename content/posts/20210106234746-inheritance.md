    Have core members and operations shared among the ones derived from it.

    OR ****overriding**** the existing operations in the base class.

When there're no custom members or operations in the derived class,
it's called [Liskov Substitution Principle]({{< relref "20210106230223-liskov_substitution_principle" >}}). In this case, objects of
derived class and base class can be substituted in both ways.

Derived classes accept all messages accepted by the base class.
