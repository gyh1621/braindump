## Constructing {#constructing}

### Default Constructor {#default-constructor}

When there are no constructor explicitly defined,
the compiler will use a default constructor.

As long as a constructor is defined, no-arg constructor
is provided by the compiler any more.


### Default Values {#default-values}

When fields of a Class are [Primitive Types]({{<relref "20210106174853-java_grammar.md" >}}), they have default values;
when they are objects, they must be given an initial value,
unless by using a [Run Time Error]({{< relref "20210115161934-run_time_error" >}}) (exception) will be thrown.

Local variables must be initialized.
`int x;  // x will get some arbitrarty value`, use before assigned a value will cause [Compile Time Error]({{< relref "20210106175817-compile_time_error" >}})


### Constructors are actually static methods {#constructors-are-actually-static-methods}


## Process of creating an object {#process-of-creating-an-object}

Consider a class called `Dog`:

1.  (first time) creating an object, or access a static method, or static field of `Dog`,
    the Java interpreter locate `Dog.class`
2.  (first time) initialize static fields
3.  allocate enough storage for a `Dog` object on the heap and wipe it to zero
4.  setting primitive types to default values and references to null (even if fields are initialized manually)
5.  execute fields definition (instance initialization)
6.  execute constructors


## `this` keyword {#this-keyword}

| position | ease | box | interval | due                  |

-   reference to current object
-   used to pass itself to another class's methods
-   used to call other constructors inside a constructor
    -   can only call one constructor
    -   must be the first action in the constructor


## Finalization {#finalization}

| position | ease | box | interval | due                  |

[Java Garbage Collector]({{< relref "20210107162957-java_garbage_collector" >}}) first calls `finalize()` when it's ready to release objects' storage,
then on second pass of garbage-collection, it reclaim the objects' memory.

The need for `finalize()` is limited to special cases where
objects can allocate storage in some way other than creating an object.

-   native methods: call non-Java code from Java

`finalize()` may not be called, so if a resource must be released,
write another method and call it explicitly.

-   `finalize()` in this case can serve as a reminder/checker
    whether the release method has been called (prevent unknown memory leaks)
