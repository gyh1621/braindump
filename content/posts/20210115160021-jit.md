## Java JIT {#java-jit}

Partially or fully converts a program into native machine code,
so JVM interpretation is not needed and thus runs much faster.


### Drawbacks {#drawbacks}

1.  Compile needs more time
2.  Result executable is larger which can cause paging
    when loaded into memory and may slow down the program


### Alternative Approach - Lazy Evaluation {#alternative-approach-lazy-evaluation}

Not JIT compile the code until it's necessary.
