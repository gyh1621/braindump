A midway between [Inheritance]({{< relref "20210106234746-inheritance" >}}) and [Composition]({{< relref "20210106234713-composition" >}}), because you place a member object
in the class you're building (like composition), but at the same time you expose
all (or part of) the methods from the member object in your new class (like inheritance).
