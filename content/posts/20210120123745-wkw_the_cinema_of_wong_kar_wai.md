## Excerpt {#excerpt}

> "How do we structure this whole dame thing", I say, "so it will reveal the mind of Wong Kar Wai?"
"That's the wrong question," he says. "What you need to ask yourself is this. Should the book be like a menu, a GPS, or a jukebox?"

> Robert Musil: Most of us spend the greatest part of our lives in the shadow of an event that hasn’t yet taken place.

> Christopher Doyle collaboration with Wong is like Bernardo Bertolucci and Vittorio Storaro

> Looking into your past, you keep lingering between fact and fiction.

> -- She also told me that you say all women in your films are her.
-- That's true.
Some say that you go through many women before you find the right one. In that sense, I'm lucky.I have one who can also be many.
That doesn't mean all my female characters are based on Esther, but in them, I can see glimpses of her. She seldom comes to the set,
but she's always been there with me. That's why her name has always been the first to appear on screen for the films that WKW produced. These are our films.
\#[Love]({{< relref "20210120125514-love" >}})

> Anyway, to read and write are completely different things. Writing is about ideas, techniques and most of all, discipline the pressure
of putting the first word on a blank sheet of paper agonizing. It's almost like being caught in a corner. It's embarrassing.

> Like Wong, Chang put enormous faith in auspicious coincidence and magical thinking. “Things will come to you if you think really hard,” he insists.

> What makes Wong's case special is that his filmmaking process isn't an attempt to render a finished idea on the screen - the way Hitchcock shot
the whole film in his head before the cameras ever started rolling. Nor is he obsessed with creating a cinematic version of the piece bien faite,
as the French once termed the perfectly-tooled drama. Instead, he places enormous faith in serendipity. Closer in spirit to an explorer than to an
architect, he sets out to discover a film, a long journey that can begin with something as ephemeral as a concept(gay Hong Kongers in Buenos Aires)
or the call of an actress’s face(Nicole Kidman’s led Wong to dream up his never-made film about a White Russian spy, Lady from Shanghai).

> Most of my films are already musicals, in a way. Just that the actors don’t sing.

> According to William Chang, you can count on three things turning up in a Wong Kar Wai film: rain, jukeboxes, and clocks.
Of these three, the last are the most inescapable. You find them tick-tocking away from the very beginning of his first personal film,
Days of Being wild when Yuddy tells Su Li-zhen she will always remember a single minute in April of 1960, to the climactic railway station
fight in his latest film, The Grandmaster, where the platform clock counts the minutes until the showdown. The omnipresent clocks are appropriate
because Wong's work is obsessed with time's many permutations-in itself, as a psychological perception, and as a cinematic device.
He speeds time up and slows it down; he makes it repeat itself and come back in tiny echoes like a cry bouncing down a canyon;
he hopscotches between the past, the present, and the future.

> I need the inspiration of a face. ... After all these years, my experience has been that a script works best when you know who is going
to play it while writing it. It's a tailor-made process.

> I don't enjoy films where I'm looking up at a person. I enjoy watching films where we are all equal and we have sympathy with the characters.

> And as said before, a screenplay is a map. Whether it's from one room to another, or from one street to another, or one city to another,
or even from one period to another, the difference is only the scale. It is also a map of the emotional ups and downs of the characters.
To make a film is like doing a [Road Movie]({{< relref "20210120134343-road_movie" >}}) on these "maps". It's also a spirit. It doesn't matter where you start, what matters is where you land.
Along the way, there are hundreds of options and you can easily lose track of your orientation. Like a bird, you fly as far as you can until you drop.
I've made all my films in that spirit.


## Notes {#notes}

-   电影里快乐的地方都是繁忙琐碎的日常
-   看完 [2046]({{< relref "20210120134700-2046" >}}) 感觉虽然剧情比花样年华多了很多，但实际都是一个人物模版的重复，剧情还是简单的：一个人忘记不了过去，永远留在了2046。
    看豆瓣评论说他的电影都是靠情绪推进的，当时不懂，现在懂了一些
-   王家卫与他的团队厌倦无聊，所以每部电影都想有点不一样 （好像确实是这样）
-   王家卫作品里多语言、人物看起来轻易的迁移有一种开放性
-   “电影世界之外的元素”，如[旺角卡门]({{< relref "20210120133011-as_tears_go_by" >}})里的云、[阿飞正传]({{< relref "20210120133135-days_of_being_wild" >}})里的森林、[春光乍泻]({{< relref "20210120133812-happy_together" >}})里的瀑布、花样年华里的街道。用这些不变的恒定的元素与电影中变换的情感、关系形成反差。
    还有[花样年华]({{< relref "20210120134113-in_the_mood_for_love" >}})里的吴哥窟，历史的废墟从一个沉默旁观者的视角看来往的男男女女。
    相似的还有慢镜头，用慢来描绘快的场面，用不真实来强调真实。 #[Slow Motion]({{< relref "20210120125348-slow_motion" >}})
    重复的音乐也是，“重复播放长长的一段，音乐就不再是背景音乐了，而变成了一个signature。然而角色是在变的，而音乐不变。”用不变来表示变
-   “王家卫的电影多隐喻，但因喜欢反复营造和渲染。加上喋喋不休的旁白作辅助，隐喻就变得有些欲盖弥彰的故意，暖昧的色调下，甚至显得有些直自。”
    “某年某月某日，因为什么事情，我会永远记住她。”
-   Fill in the details to the framework when shooting.
    Beginning, middle and end, but not necessarily in that order.
    About moods and images.
    [As Tears Go By]({{< relref "20210120133011-as_tears_go_by" >}}) - framework quite detailed
    [Happy Together]({{< relref "20210120133812-happy_together" >}}) - virtually nonexistent


## [As Tears Go By]({{< relref "20210120133011-as_tears_go_by" >}}) {#as-tears-go-by--20210120133011-as-tears-go-by-dot-md}

-   The Apu Trilogy meets Mean Streets -> Final Victory
-   wah's visit to Ngor on Lantau Island - "Take my Breath away" in "Top Gun"
-   shoot at 12f/s, stretching things out by double printing #[Slow Motion]({{< relref "20210120125348-slow_motion" >}})
-   红蓝色调来自Tam


## [Days of Being Wild]({{< relref "20210120133135-days_of_being_wild" >}}) {#days-of-being-wild--20210120133135-days-of-being-wild-dot-md}

-   First truly personal work
-   same Chinese title as “Rebel Without a Cause”
-   采用sync sound
-   刚开始想拍人物寻找自我的故事，分成两部分。像《霍乱中的爱情一样》，对两个女的来说张国荣就是霍乱，
    一部分拍一个女的不能原谅过去，另一部分拍一个女的拒绝回忆过去
-   《Heartbreak Tango》中把所有故事拼起来得到完整叙事后有的命运注定感，生活中人们不能控制的部分，是拍这个电影的初衷
-   绿色来自小时公寓的颜色，周围都是绿树
-   关于墨镜： #[WKW]({{< relref "20210120123800-wkw" >}})
    -   从[旺角卡门]({{< relref "20210120133011-as_tears_go_by" >}})开始戴的，当时拍得太累了，需要个空间来思考
    -   “每个艺术家都有自己的墨镜，关乎主体性和客体性，当他们带上墨镜，他们就变成了另一个人”
    -   是一个在公共场合下掩饰保护自己的工具，给自己反应余地
    -   象征权力，不让别人看到“自己”，比如在片场
-   儿时成长街区是后来电影灵感：
    -   裁缝店 [Eros]({{< relref "20210120134922-eros" >}})
    -   作家，武打馆街区 [The Grandmaster]({{< relref "20210120134530-the_grandmaster" >}}), [Ashes of Time]({{< relref "20210120133642-ashes_of_time" >}})
    -   印度街区 [Chungking Express]({{< relref "20210120133406-chungking_express" >}})


## [Fallen Angels]({{< relref "20210120133536-fallen_angels" >}}) {#fallen-angels--20210120133536-fallen-angels-dot-md}


## [Chungking Express]({{< relref "20210120133406-chungking_express" >}}) {#chungking-express--20210120133406-chungking-express-dot-md}

-   Godard and Truffaut for ‘60s Paris
-   Wong evokes a Hong Kong full of solitary souls who can’t quite bridge the canyon separating their bright public faces from their lonely private dreams
-   As open to life as it’s characters, the movie smiles tenderly on those brave enough to keep risking their hearts
-   Some parts shoot at his father's nightclub in the basement of Chungking Mansion
-   与[堕落天使]({{< relref "20210120133536-fallen_angels" >}})为硬币两面，都为人与人之间的距离，一个是由疏离到后来的连接，一个是即使物理上距离近但实际却是疏离；
    同时重庆森林里都是普通人，而堕落天使里都是异类，所以堕落天使里的普通人老爸会显得格外温情


## [Ashes of Time]({{< relref "20210120133642-ashes_of_time" >}}) {#ashes-of-time--20210120133642-ashes-of-time-dot-md}

-   Loved by 大陆, disliked by HK
-   First version: music not satisfied -> Ashes of Time Redux
-   对东邪西毒的同情，用过去来辩解
-   “Nearly all martial arts are about the hero's triumph, but what triumphs here is the barren,
    bewitching land that was there before Ouyang and the other characters and that will outlast them for eons - humanity is just passing through.”
    "The desert is a philosophy"
-   对一个东西的痴迷使得人物都被困在了自己的沙漠里，就像soul里的那片荒漠一样
-   “Encyclopedia of wuxia”


## [Happy Together]({{< relref "20210120133812-happy_together" >}}) {#happy-together--20210120133812-happy-together-dot-md}

-   A story about being rejected when you expected acceptance
-   A film about "non-accepted" relationship
-   why argentina？
    like Manuel Puig, wanted to use "Heartbreak Tango" as title
-   sick of being asked about 97 hand over, Argentina is the furthest place from HK
-   initial idea: [Road Movie]({{< relref "20210120134343-road_movie" >}})
-   张国荣档期冲突了要回去，但当时还没有完整的剧本。所以王家卫只能尽量多拍一些他的镜头，也是那时知道了最后瀑布只能是梁朝伟一个人去看的，故事也大多关于梁朝伟
-   Political Elements
    -   Happy Together is supposed to be a question, no one knows what will happen after 97, which is also why Tony never returns to HK at the end of the movie
    -   "Let's start all over again"
    -   Tony is trying to reach out to his father for reconciliation
    -   waterfall: dark, powerful, things united


## [In the Mood for Love]({{< relref "20210120134113-in_the_mood_for_love" >}}) {#in-the-mood-for-love--20210120134113-in-the-mood-for-love-dot-md}

-   巧妙地讲述简单的故事线
-   出色的服饰、场景
-   广告狂人的开场饮酒场面借鉴了它
-   结尾本来要以梁朝伟报复的勾引张曼玉去新加坡上床结束，因为她瞧不起他妻子，最后却因时间来不及了换成了现在的结尾
-   本来要拍三个以吃为场景的故事，后来第二个故事越拍越长成了现在的结果、拍好的第一个故事用在了后来的蓝莓之夜
-   [阿飞正传]({{< relref "20210120133135-days_of_being_wild" >}})精神续作，女主名字沿用
-   对王家卫是还原小时生活场景的私人电影：饭菜、外出打饭、电台、音乐


## [My Blueberry Night]({{< relref "20210120134233-my_blueberry_night" >}}) {#my-blueberry-night--20210120134233-my-blueberry-night-dot-md}

-   [Road Movie]({{< relref "20210120134343-road_movie" >}}), each city supposed to be a tribute to an American film
-   A streetcar named desire - Memphis
-   The Cincinnati Kid - Vegas and a town nearby
-   dyed Natalie Portman's hair blonde as a tribute to Steve McQueen
-   LA of Robert Altman - cannot afford to shoot
-   The title is not for purpose of being sweet but something the girl wanted to forget.


## [The Grandmaster]({{< relref "20210120134530-the_grandmaster" >}}) {#the-grandmaster--20210120134530-the-grandmaster-dot-md}

-   distant yet with a mutual understanding
-   three stages to be a grandmaster
    -   becoming yourself
    -   understanding the challenge of others
    -   sharing with the world
