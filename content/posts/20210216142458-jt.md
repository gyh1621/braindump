### Reading Sailboat - Itâ€™s Mental Model and Integration with other IoT Services/Features {#reading-sailboat-it-s-mental-model-and-integration-with-other-iot-services-features}

-   [ ] where did you get the idea of creating sailboat
    when I was reading your post "It's mental model...", the fact some companies
    have so many lora devices shocked me. so I'm curious where did you get the
    idea of creating sailboat?
-   [ ] past experiences
    in the document, you describe a detailed procedure of setting up IoT devices from lab
    to sites, it's so detailed as I think, do you have actual experiences before?
