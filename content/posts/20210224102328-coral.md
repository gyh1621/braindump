## Developing {#developing}

-   run [Brazil]({{< relref "20210224101857-brazil" >}}) build when makeing code changes in packages
    -   **select platform:** `brazil ws --use --platform AL2012`
    -   **sync versionset:** `brazil ws --sync --md`
    -   **build service and dependent packages:** `brazil-recursive-cmd brazil-build`


## Client {#client}


## Server {#server}

-   In [Brazil]({{< relref "20210224101857-brazil" >}}), the service will probably consists of three packages:
    1.  a model package defining operations and data types
    2.  a low-level package containing business logic, called "activities"
    3.  a package containing the service configuration and activity implementations


## Model {#model}

Model defines the contract for the applications.

-   model consists of shapes, operations and traits
-   can be defined in XML, WSDLs, etc.
-   must be built in a [Brazil]({{< relref "20210224101857-brazil" >}}) package


### Shapes {#shapes}

<https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Coral/Server/Walkthrough#Shapes>

Describe the nouns in the service's lexicon.

simple
: represents a single, atomic value

complex
: logically group values together as structures, lists, or maps

To enforce a pathway for non-invasive service evolution,
****operations must deal with complex shapes defined as structures****,
even if they only need to communicate with a single value.


### Operations {#operations}

<https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Coral/Server/Walkthrough#Operations%5Fand%5FService%5FDescriptions>

Describe the verbs in the service's lexicon:
waht your service can do and what data is needed.
