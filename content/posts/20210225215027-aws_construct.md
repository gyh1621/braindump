This library includes constructs that represent all the resources available on AWS


## Three levels of constructs {#three-levels-of-constructs}


### CFN Resources - L1 {#cfn-resources-l1}

Also called Cfn (short for CloudFormation)

-   periodically generated from [AWS CloudFormation Resource Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html)
    -   named CfnXyz, Xyz is name of the resource.
        e.g., CfnBucket represents [AWS::S3::Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket.html) resource
-   must explicitly configure all resource properties


### L2 {#l2}

-   provide higher-level, intent-based API
-   properties with defaults, also have bolierplate and glue logic
-   e.g. [s3.Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk%5Faws-s3.Bucket.html) class


### Patterns - L3 {#patterns-l3}

-   designed to help you complete common tasks in AWS, often involving multiple kinds of resources


## Initialization {#initialization}

Define a construct by instantiating the class, three parameters involved:

-   Scope
-   unique within this scope, as namespace for things defined inside this construct
-   A set of properties or keywords arguments
