: How Linux Works


## Device files as device I/O interface {#device-files-as-device-i-o-interface}


### not all devices have device files {#not-all-devices-have-device-files}


#### e.g., network interfaces, should be like character devices, but due to the difficulty using file interfaces, the kernel offers other I/O interfaces {#e-dot-g-dot-network-interfaces-should-be-like-character-devices-but-due-to-the-difficulty-using-file-interfaces-the-kernel-offers-other-i-o-interfaces}


## Block device {#block-device}


### file type: b {#file-type-b}


### program access data from a block device in fixed chunks {#program-access-data-from-a-block-device-in-fixed-chunks}


#### total size is fixed -> easy to split and index {#total-size-is-fixed-easy-to-split-and-index}


### disk device is a type of block device {#disk-device-is-a-type-of-block-device}


## Character device {#character-device}


### file type: c {#file-type-c}


### work with data streams: read/write data with character device {#work-with-data-streams-read-write-data-with-character-device}


### don't have size {#don-t-have-size}


### example: printer {#example-printer}


## Pipe device {#pipe-device}


### file type: p {#file-type-p}


### like character device, but with another process ar the end of I/O stream instead of a kernel driver {#like-character-device-but-with-another-process-ar-the-end-of-i-o-stream-instead-of-a-kernel-driver}


## Socket device {#socket-device}


### file type: s {#file-type-s}


### used for interprocess communication, usually outside of /dev directory {#used-for-interprocess-communication-usually-outside-of-dev-directory}


## sysfs device path {#sysfs-device-path}
